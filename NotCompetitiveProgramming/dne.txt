Orange uses visceral, almost haunting language to connect contemporary Native experiences with historical violence and survival. The phrase “memories we don’t remember” suggests an inherited trauma that exists even if it isn’t consciously acknowledged. His use of blood and bones as metaphors highlights how history is embodied, not just remembered. The emphasis on collective experience ("we") builds a sense of shared cultural struggle. This passage establishes the theme of liminality, as characters exist between past and present, shaped by history while trying to define their own identity.

The most shocking element of the prologue is its blunt depiction of violence against Native people, especially in the Sand Creek Massacre and the Oakland Coliseum’s brutal history. The language is raw and unfiltered, forcing the reader to confront historical atrocities rather than view them as distant events. His use of second-person narration makes the reader complicit, breaking the barrier between history and the present. The prologue sets up a world where Native identity is inherently tied to survival, where generational trauma is inescapable. Orange’s use of hybridity—blending historical accounts with modern commentary—reinforces how Indigenous people are forced to live between multiple, often contradictory, realities.

Orange opens with these historical accounts to show that Indigenous identity today is shaped by a legacy of violence, displacement, and resistance. By immediately immersing the reader in these brutal moments, he makes it impossible to ignore the ongoing effects of colonization. He challenges the idea that history is in the past—these events are still alive in Native people’s daily experiences, a core aspect of multidimensionality in Indigenous life. The novel’s characters, like the people in these stories, are shaped by forces beyond their control, yet they persist in defining themselves. This introduction makes it clear that the novel will not be about nostalgia or romanticized Native identity but about the complexities of survival in modern America.

Toney views his fetal alcohol syndrome as an uncontrollable force that defines him, something outside his agency. The comparison to a “monster” and a “made-up thing” shows how disconnected he feels from himself and from a stable sense of identity. This speaks to the theme of prescribed identity, as Toney sees himself through the lens of how others perceive him—an outsider, damaged, unwanted. His words also reflect liminality, as he exists between two worlds: the person he wants to be and the person society tells him he is. This internal conflict is a major part of his struggle throughout the novel.

Toney is deeply self-aware, yet he also resigns himself to a sense of inevitability, believing he is already defined by his circumstances. He reflects the stereotype of the "tragic Native"—someone stuck in cycles of poverty, addiction, and crime. However, Orange gives him depth, showing that he understands these stereotypes and resents them. His narration forces the reader to grapple with the question: is Toney a product of his environment, or is he making choices that reinforce it? This tension is part of his character’s duality, as he is both self-destructive and self-reflective at the same time.

Toney recognizes that people look at him and don’t see a connection to history or culture, only a struggling young man. The idea that he has "no history" reflects the stereotype of urban Native people being disconnected from their traditions. This also speaks to hybridity, as he exists in both a modern world and a cultural history that he feels distant from. Orange shows how external perceptions shape self-perception, trapping Toney in an identity he doesn’t fully claim. The irony is that Toney does have history—he just doesn’t know how to access it.

Toney embodies many stereotypes—poverty, criminality, self-destruction—but Orange refuses to let him be reduced to them. He is deeply introspective and painfully aware of how he is seen, showing that these tropes don’t define his full reality. By giving Toney a voice, Orange challenges the one-dimensional portrayals of Native characters in mainstream media. Toney’s struggle to define himself against external expectations is an example of prescribed class and prescribed identity, as he is boxed in by societal views that dictate his future before he even has a chance to define it himself.

Dene sees storytelling as a way to preserve history and identity, making him a counterpoint to Toney, who struggles to see his own history. His desire for meaning shows that he is not just recording stories—he is trying to reclaim a narrative that has often been told by outsiders. This aligns with the theme of power, as he attempts to shift control over Indigenous storytelling from external sources back to Native voices. His work embodies multidimensionality, as he recognizes the complexity of modern Native identity rather than reducing it to stereotypes. His mission reflects both hope and responsibility.

Dene serves as a bridge between past and present, showing how history can be preserved in a meaningful way. He acknowledges the trauma that has shaped Native people but also believes in the power of their voices. His storytelling project is a form of resistance against erasure, giving space to people who have often been silenced. Unlike Toney, who feels like history is something done to him, Dene actively works to capture and honor it. This positions him as a character who embodies duality, as he exists between documenting the past and shaping the present.
